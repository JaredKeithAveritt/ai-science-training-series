There was some trouble with running the code beyond a single GPU. I tried running on the single-gpu and it was the only que i was able to run (i tried full-node , training-gpu as well).
I also tried running the pre-implimented resnet34 train_resnet34_hvd.py (i realize this was not the homework, I was just wanting to try the simpliest case first).
I have included the accuract plots for 1 GPU only.
